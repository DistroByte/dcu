      <h2>What is ScaleF?</h2>
      <img src="scale.png">
      <p>ScaleF is an informative app and hardware combination that tells you when your fridge is running low on food.
        The goal of this app is not only to help people to budget properly, but to save people multiple trips to the
        shops and give them a strong insight into their food storage in the fridge.</p><br>
      <p>The great thing about ScaleF is that we are bridging a gap in the smart fridge market by introducing an
        affordable alternative. The main competitors in this particular market are LG and Samsung, however these
        companies are selling their smart fridges for roughly €3000. We at ScaleF believe that the entry price to this
        market is far too high for the average consumer. Because of this, we have created an affordable alternative to
        the "traditional" smart fridge.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <h3>Mobile Application</h3>
      <p>With ScaleF, our plan was to make it accessible to everyone to connect with their smart appliance in their
        home. In order to be able to do this, we developed an application that works seamlessly with our product, just
        download it from your app store!</p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>ScaleF is a replacement for the shelves of your fridge which incorporates a weighing scale. You can modify what
        ScaleF is set to detect, and what the maximun weight of something should be.</p>
      <p>For example, if there is a scale named "Milk", the user can tell the app that they would always like 2 litres
        of milk in their fridge, once it goes below that weight, the app sends a notification and also displays a
        warning in the app</p>

        goodbye to second trips to the shops to pick up that one forgotten item. Frustration at the empty milk carton
        will be a thing of the past!</p>

        and pay later. Find a payment plan that suits you.</p><br>
