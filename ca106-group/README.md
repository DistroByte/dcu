## Using Git

When editing a file, please make sure that when finished you commit and push your changes.

- Navigate to the source control tab of VSCode (the one that looks like a branch)
- Stage your changes (with the plus icon) and add a message to the commit (something clear and concise)
- Commit your changes with the tick at the top of the window
- Push your changes by typing `ctrl+shift+p`, then `git push` or clicking the refresh button on the bottom bar

If you have any issues please ping me and I'll get back to you
