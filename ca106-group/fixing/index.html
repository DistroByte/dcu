    <h2>Game Company</h2>
    <p>
      Nintendo now one of the biggest videogame companies in the world. Has been
      creating memories for many generations. For example, I used to play the
      Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS when I was younger. The reason I love this
      company so much is thanks to their humble beginning. They originally began
      as making beautifully crafted playing cards which were known as Hanafuda.
      All being created by the one person Fusajiro Yamauchi. His playing cards
      had gotten so popular that he would soon need to hire staff to aid him
      with his company, The Nintendo Company. These cards were well-known
      all-around Japan and very well made. However, were known for some other
      reasons. Eventually the Hanafuda meaning flower cards got tied into
      gambling and gangsters such as the ‚ÄúYakuza‚Äù. Thanks to this, people
      stopped playing Hanafuda as it was tied to gambling and crime. Even though
      this was a blow to the company the success that these cards brought to
      Nintendo let it continue to thrive. Where a new leader was appointed
      called Hiroshi Yamauchi. He was the one that brought Nintendo to a new
      frontier, Video Gaming. Although he suffered backlash by his employees and
      having his authority questioned by many, while also failing on different
      projects and business ideas such as love Hotels and instant rice etc.
      Almost bringing the company to the brink of bankruptcy. But all that
      changed when he brought Nintendo‚Äôs focus into toy making. This was thanks
      to Gunpei Yokoi who was seen by Hiroshi Yamauchi playing with his little
      invention a claw game. Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed him as the lead inventor
      for innovative products for Nintendo and it continued to thrive. Gunpei
      Yokoi would also be the one to shift Nintendo‚Äôs focus to video gaming.
      Where he saw another passenger on a bullet train going to work playing
      with his lcd calculator which gave Gunpei Yoko the idea to start creating
      the ‚ÄúGame and Watch‚Äù and starting the family of Nintendo‚Äôs Pocket Consoles
      such as the Gameboy.

    <h2>Console</h2>
    <p>
      Created in 1989 this in my opinion is where Nintendo shined the most of
      all time. It was where toys and computers got combined together. Although
      the Gameboy was big and couldn‚Äôt fit in your pocket. It was a major hit as
      Gunpei wanted it to be able to last an entire day of use and last the test
      of time thus explaining the use of such materials making it stronger. The
      use of game cartridges was where it would shine the most and I would argue
      were the first to make it the best. What I love about Nintendo is that
      they don‚Äôt need to use the most advanced technology in their products it
      just works and provides you with entertainment. The Gameboy and Gameboy
      Colour (Which as the name implies had a colour screen vs the normal green
      toned lcd ) sold 118.9 million units worldwide.

    <h2>Retro Game</h2>
    <p>
      An old game created by Alexy Pajitnov in 1984 and still loved by many to
      this day. Tetris is one of the most played games (where it sold 33 million
      cartridges for the Gameboy alone) and is still very much alive and
      available on many different platforms where their newest game is Tetris
      Effect Connected which is the one that offers the most artistic gameplay
      ever. Tetris derived from the word‚Äôs tetra meaning 4 from Greek and tennis
      which was Alexy Pajitnov‚Äôs favourite sport. The reason he chose tetra is
      because each of the shapes in the game are created with just 4 blocks
      called a tetrominoe. The main rules of the game are simple but hard to
      master just complete the lines by moving the tetrominoes into place to
      form a line to which it will disappear while the speed of gravity
      increases where the blocks will move faster within each level. There are
      so many versions of tetris that you can play it on anything almost from
      the iPod to a Russian Van‚Äôs dashboard its everywhere. (Even on my website!!!üòÇ)

        <h2>First Game Inventor</h2>
        <p>
          It is believed that Physicist William Higinbotham created the first video
          game in October 1958. It was a tennis game similar to Pong. The reason for
          its invention was to showcase something new and interesting in the
          Brookhaven National Laboratory. The exhibitions were rather boring to
          William Higinbotham so he sought out to create a game using a small
          analogue computer which could output curves and bouncing balls. To which
          he called his game ‚ÄúTennis for Two‚Äù, he didn‚Äôt realise that his work was
          such a big hit at the time and didn‚Äôt patent his idea.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There were always long lines from the visitors waiting to play his game. It is rather
          interesting how this inventor is known for just his invention of a
          videogame rather than his expertise in nuclear arms control. Where he
          helped found the Federation of American Scientists, while also serving as
          its chairman and executive secretary.
