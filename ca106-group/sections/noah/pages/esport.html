      <p>The definition of an athlete, as it stands with Collins Dictionary, is "a person who does a sport, especially
        athletics, or track and field events." And Cambridge Dictionary describes an athlete as "a person who is very
        good at sports or physical exercise, especially one who competes in organized events." Esports players play on a
        high level and train for hours a day while also eating healthy and exercising regularly. Many teams have
        personal trainers for thier players to keep them in shape but also practice.</p>

    <div class="main">
      <p>The phrases "or physical exercise," and "especially athletics" are used, meaning the term athletes is not
        exclusive to physical versions of sports. So surely, as long as esports can be considered a sport, pro esports
        players should be consider athletes. There's nothing about needing to being at peak physical condition, though
        it may be a surprise that many pro esports players are involved in a strict regime of physical exercise and
        dieting.</p>
