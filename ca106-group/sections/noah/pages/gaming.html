      <p>Back when we were younger, you would go to your one friend's house and he was the guy with all the new games or
        console. You would stay there and play all day, but now there is so many games to choose from and the amount of
        gaming platforms has grown so much that anyone can get a cheap gaming platform or games.</p>

          <p>Many parents are against gaming as they hear from the media that it can cause violence and make your child
            a trouble maker. But gaming can do quite the opposite to that. While many studys widely say that playing
            video games is intellectually lazy, such play actually may strengthen a range of cognitive skills such as
            spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception, according to several studies reviewed in the article.
            This is particularly true for shooter video games, which are often violent. A 2013 meta-analysis found that
            playing shooter video games improved a player's capacity to think about objects in three dimensions just as
            well as academic courses designed to enhance these same skills, according to the study. Playing video games
            may also help children develop problem-solving skills. The more adolescents reported playing strategic video
            games, such as role-playing games, the more they improved in problem solving and school grades the following
            year, according to a long-term study published in 2013. Children's creativity was also enhanced by playing
            any kind of video game, including violent games, but not when the children used other forms of technology,
            such as a computer or cell phone, other research revealed. Children don't need to play games that very
            intensive games to improve or relax, they can play simple but also help them relax such as a game like angry
            birds. A study said. "If playing video games simply makes people happier, this seems to be a fundamental
            emotional benefit to consider,"</p>
