            <h1>Streamers</h1>
            <p>Streaming has allowed many video game fans to make a living outside of the traditional 9 to 5 job. There
              are many video game lovers who make a living by recording Let’s Play videos on video games on YouTube and
              many of these Let’s Players eventually turn to live streaming where they stream themselves playing games
              several times a week. Popular streamers can make big money while streaming on platforms like Twitch and as
              people subscribe to their channel for 5 euro or give a donation of any amount. Streaming has become a very
              big thing recently, to the point where these streaming platforms are now signing big personalities to just
              soly stream on their platform. As well streaming allows the content creator to interact with their viewers
              live giving more to the enjoyment of streaming for both the viewer and the streamer.</p>
