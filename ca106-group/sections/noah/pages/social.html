      <p>Video gamers have been a growing part of our culture for a long time. Whether you are an old school gamer
        playing with gameboys and the nintendo 64 or trying to beat the next level of Candy Crush on your lunch break,
        you are part of the gaming world. Over the years this world has had to deal with a lot of stereotypes and false
        claims. One of the most damaging of these claims is the media blaming violence and other crimes on the influence
        of games. This is just not true, A company called Qutee is looking to remove these stereotype of the gaming
        world. Qutee is data-led discussion platform that is giving people in the gaming community a voice. </p>

      <p>A benefit to gaming is that many gamers form strong friendships from people they meet online and game with.
        Around two-thirds of gamers claim that they have met up to five friends while playing games and another 37% say
        they have made even more. In an online poll, gamers were asked what they believed to be the main benefit of
        gaming, over 40% said that gaming improves their emotional well-being. That’s a serious benefit if you consider
        that one in five people in America experience mental health issues each year. Gaming brings people together from
        all walks of life and all over the globe, for this reason I think gaming has had a major impact on many peoples
        lives for the better.</p>

      <p>The voice of gamers is going to play a big role in the future as gaming culture continues to develop and grow.
        It’s time we started listening to the people that actually play these games rather than people that just want
        someone to blame for the violence they see on the news. Gaming is not a perfect world. There are flaws such as
        gaming addiction that need to be addressed. But for the most part, it seems that gaming has a positive impact
        and should be treated as such.</p>
