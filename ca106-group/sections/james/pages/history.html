          A look at how the gaming industry has changed from cartridge based games to
          games being available to stream from a central server!

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          Though video games are found today in homes worldwide, they actually got their start in the research labs of
          scientists.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          In 1952, for instance, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or a
          tic-tac-toe, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Cambridge.

          In 1962, Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology invented Spacewar!, a computer-based space
          combat video game for a cutting-edge computer mostly found at universities. It was the first video game that
          could be played on multiple computer installations.

        <h2>The First Console</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          In 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., invented a prototype multiplayer,
          multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as “The Brown Box.”
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the
          system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the
          primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.

        <h2>Dawn of the Home Console</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          Yet, one of the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s Pong, the first arcade video game, which
          the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its
          arcade counterpart.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          In 1977, Atari released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured
          joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the
          second generation of the video game consoles.

        <h2>Today's Landscape</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          From there, once cartirdges that allowed games to be bought and swapped, the gaming industry took off.
          Developers began to make games that, while not 100% bug free, were very well polished and had very few major
          issues. Over time, as the internet changed the way games were distributed, games became less polished on
          realease date. The recent launch of Cyberpunk 2077 is a great example of this. The game developers were put
          under huge stress to finish that game by the end of 2020, but as it so happens, they can still push updates
          over the internet to players. This is both a blessing and a curse for developers.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Developers now have more time to finish a game, and continue improving it, but they also can never really
          escape the development of it. Games can be discontinued but that is usually met with opposition from the
          playerbase.
