        <h2>Current State of the Industry</h2>
        <p>
          Today's landscape has massively changed from games that were on a cartridge to today's downloads of over 150GB
          for one game. This shift is helped by advancing technology, hardware and skill, and players' want for bigger
          and better games

        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          In today's world, computer hardware has come on leaps and bounds in terms of affordability and processing
          power. In 1969, the Apollo craft that landed on the moon had less memory than the cheapest of the newest range
          of CPUs and GPUs by Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          This means that massively processing time intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator
          2020 that can run at really high definitions (think 4k) and at really high framerates (think 120fps+) are
          becoming more and more common.

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          Software too has become much more powerful with more and more options for developers to make games with
          whatever realism or graphical fidelity they like. Games run inside machines called engines, which are baically
          enviroments that interface between the code and the final product.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Software for games, and the community surrounding that software, has grown exponentially with services like
          Skype, Teamspeak and recently, Discord for text and voice chat. Hardware usually comes with some form of
          control software; like the Logitech G Hub for controlling mice and keyboards for example.

      <div class="content justify">
        <h2>Distribution</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          Games are now distributed through keys which provide access to downloads as opposed to physical shops with
          cartridges. Services like Steam and Epic streamline this process and allow management of game libraries.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Games can still be bought as "hard copies" but are almost always a license key to download. Patches and
          updates are pushed out regularly for multiplayer games and less frequently for singleplayer games.
