          Game delivery has already begun to change yet again, this time to a subscription based model. The tech giants
          like Google and Microsoft are already developing ways for games to be streamed to anywhere in the world with
          an internet connection so that games need only be stored in a central server.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          This avoids the need to own a dedicated, bulky console and only requires a smart TV at the very worst, as all
          the computations are done on the server, not locally.

          Virtual Reality (or VR) has started to take off, it invloves tracking your head and hands to allow interaction
          with the game's environment. This technology is quite resource intensive and thus is not as accessible as
          other forms of entertainment, but as the tech improves, so does the price to performance.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Racing and flying simulators are also getting a boost as more accurate controllers and game engines (heh) are
          developed and released. These allow the game to be more accurate and give a more realistic feel. These are
          some of just a few ways that game devs are dreaming up to expand games to a wider audience.

          As games progress, so too, do the non-player characters, or NPCs that dwell in those games. NPCs were coded on
          an if/then style, but these days they have a behaviour tree to allow complex decisons to be made.
