        <h2>Gaming Industry Worth</h2>
        <p>
          From the small arcade that first started with the small space invaders game to the multi-billion dollar giant
          of an industry the gaming sector is, let's take a look at the figures.

        <h2>Current Estimates for 2020</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          According to We PC, the gaming market could be worth over <b>$90 billion</b> by the end of 2020. That figure
          includes consoles, computers, and mobiles, with the figure expected to grow by
          2.3% annually.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Mobile Games account for nearly 60% of that share, which is in no small part due to the accessibility of
          mobile games. They don't require dedicated PCs or consoles, hence they can be played anywhere, they also
          usually don't need much graphical power and thus almost every phone could run them.

        <h2>Online Content</h2>
        <p class="justify">
          With the ever growing audience on streaming platforms like Twitch, live reactions to games draw in hundreds
          of thousands of viewers, promoting a certain game more and more until it becomes as popular as games like
          Minecraft and Tetris.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          These streams bring in revenue through advertisements and "donations" which incentivise the individual to keep
          playing the game. The same rules apply to sites like YouTube also. ESports is a branch of that and is expected
          to bring in between $1.1 and $1.3 billion in revenue in 2020
