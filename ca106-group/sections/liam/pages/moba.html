    <h2>What is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena?</h2>
      <p> This is one of the most popular genres for esports, along with First-Person Shooter Games.
          Also known as MOBAs, they take on characteristics from other genres such as real-time 
          strategy games and Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Where they differ though is 
          the format they are played in. MOBAs are mainly focused around competitive play. Games are 
          usually long in terms of time, due to the objective of the game being long-stretched. Players 
          compete against each until they reach this objective and win.

      <p> MOBAs are objective focused and team-based. Teams will face off against one another in hopes to
          reach their objective before their oppenent does. </p></div>

    <h2>Popular Early MOBA Games </h2>    
      <p> Starcraft, Aeon of Strife is one of the most early MOBA games. It involved defence and attack strategies
          that we see in today's Mulitplayer Online Battle Arena Games we see today.
