    <h2>What is a Role-Playing Game?</h2>
      <p> Known to gamers as RPG, a Role-Playing Game is a gaming genre that revolves around the player to take
          on a character from a storyline and advance through that storyline. As the game progresses, the character
          will have to become stronger in order to deal with more challenging foes.

    <h2>Attributes of Role-Playing Games </h2>
      <p> As mentioned in the previous heading, RPGs have a storyline that the player will follow in order to
          complete the game. This storyline involves overcoming certain obstacles in order to progress. This usually 
          involves the strengthening of the character's physical and mental attributes. In some RPGs, you'll either have
          more attributes that are already listed or none at all. We'll explore more of these in the examples section
