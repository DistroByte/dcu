    <h2>Attributes of Battle Royale Games</h2>
      <p>In Battle Royale Games, you'll usually find yourself acquiring resources in order to gain the upper-hand
        against other opponents. The stronger you are, the more likely your odds of survival are. Of course, there
        are some exceptions, that you will see in the example section. Finally, a battle-royale game reveals it's true
        essence through competition involving a large community of players. The most popular battle-royale games today
        stick to 100 players per game competing against one another. Of course, this number varies, depending on the
        "match mode" and of course, the popularity of the game.

    <h2> A Different Battle Royale</h2>
      <p>Fall Guys differs from the typical Battle Royale Games. The game doesn't require the need to collect resources,
        like the way Fornite, PUBG and Warzone do. The game requires you to complete 5 rounds, each round getting rid of a
        number of players and the final round crowning the winner.
