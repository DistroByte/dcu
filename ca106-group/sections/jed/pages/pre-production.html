        <h2>What happens in pre-production?</h2>
        <p>
          This is where every project begins. Essentially, pre-production defines 
          what the game is about, its purpose, and what it’s going to take to make it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might have a great idea for a type of game, a story you want to bring to life, 
          or you may want to build one that leverages a certain type of technology 
          (e.g. VR, a new controller, or console). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This stage can last anywhere between a week to a year, depending on the project type, 
        resources and finances available, and typically takes up to 20% of the total production time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, the team is usually quite small or could only consist of one person! 
        There should be programmers who will build the foundation of the core game, 
        a video game producer who handles the business aspect of the project (particularly financials and marketing), 
        and a concept artist who sets the tone for the project early on by developing artwork and sketches.
      </p>
      <p>The information gathered during this stage of pre-production forms the basis of the Game Design Document.</p>

        <h2>The Game Design Document (GDD)</h2>
        <p>
          A Game Design Document (GDD) helps everyone understand 
          and get on board with the greater vision of the project.
          The GDD is continuously updated and refined throughout production. 
          This could be due to technical or financial restraints, or simply changing plans. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people, especially smaller developers, like to use more 
          agile development techniques which are less about process 
          and documentation and more about just building things. However, 
          larger studios prefer a different approach.

        <h2 style=color:rgb(0,195,255)>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          The aim is to get a prototype up and running as soon as possible to test 
          if your ideas actually work and if the game is as you had hoped. 
          Prototyping can also reveal unexpected challenges, which could 
          potentially change the entire course of your project.

          Placeholder assets are used to save time and money. These low-quality assets 
          stand in for things like weapons and props during the early testing phase, 
          and if approved, they’re replaced with final, high quality versions later on.
