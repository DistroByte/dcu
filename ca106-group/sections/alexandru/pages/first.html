      <p> There are so many games in todays age that are so complex and intricate that
        we can't even comprehend how older generations had fun with tiny pixels that would
        only bounce back and forth.
        It wasnt even possible for these generations to
        have access to a fraction of the hardware we have today.
        Most scientists had the posssiblity to create and play games as their
        labs had computers that had the capabilities of doing so such as
        Physicist William Higinbotham. Who created the first ever
        game. Some say he was the inspiration that lead to the creation of Pong.</p>

      <p>It was a tennis game. The reason for its invention was
        to showcase something new and interesting in the Brookhaven National
        Laboratory. The exhibitions were rather boring to William Higinbotham so
        he sought out to create a game using a small analogue computer which
        could output curves and bouncing balls. To which he called his game
        “Tennis for Two”, he didn’t realise that his work was such a big hit at
        the time and didn’t patent his idea. There were always long lines from
        the visitors waiting to play his game.</p>

    <div class="main">
      <p>It is rather interesting how this scientist is known for just his
        invention of a videogame rather than his expertise in nuclear arms
        control. Where he helped found the Federation of American Scientists,
        while also serving as its chairman and executive secretary.</p>
