      <p>Although they dominate the video game market I feel that Nintendo are the best at it. Eventhough Playstation and Xbox focus
      on releasing the best hardware and the best graphics, Nintendo makes do with alright hardware and makes up for it with their games 
      that have always impressed us. From Mario to The Legend of Zelda their stories are what 
      makes them the best.</p>

      <p>Nintendo now one of the biggest videogame companies in the world. Has been
      creating memories for many generations. For example, I used to play the
      Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS when I was younger and now my brother plays the Nintendo Switch. 
      The reason I love this company so much is thanks to their humble beginning.</p></div>

<div class="main">
      <p>They originally began making beautifully crafted playing cards which were known as Hanafuda.
      All being created by the one person Fusajiro Yamauchi. His playing cards
      had gotten so popular that he would soon need to hire staff to aid him
      with his company, The Nintendo Company. These cards were well-known
      all-around Japan and very well made. However, were known for some other
      reasons. Eventually the Hanafuda meaning flower cards got tied into
      gambling and gangsters such as the “Yakuza”. Thanks to this, people
      stopped playing Hanafuda as it was tied to gambling and crime. Even though
      this was a blow to the company the success that these cards brought to
      Nintendo let it continue to thrive.</p></div>

<div class="main">     
      <p>Where a new leader was appointed called Hiroshi Yamauchi. He was the one that brought Nintendo to a new
      frontier, Video Gaming. Although he suffered backlash by his employees and
      having his authority questioned by many, while also failing on different
      projects and business ideas such as love Hotels and instant rice etc.
      Almost bringing the company to the brink of bankruptcy. But all that
      changed when he brought Nintendo’s focus into toy making.</p></div>

<div class="pic"><img src="../images/hiroshi.jpg" width="40%"></div>
<div class="main">
      <p>This was thanks to Gunpei Yokoi who was seen by Hiroshi Yamauchi playing with his little
      invention a claw game. Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed him as the lead inventor
      for innovative products for Nintendo and it continued to thrive. Gunpei
      Yokoi would also be the one to shift Nintendo’s focus to video gaming.
      Where he saw another passenger on a bullet train going to work playing
      with his lcd calculator which gave Gunpei Yoko the idea to start creating
      the “Game and Watch” and starting the family of Nintendo’s Pocket Consoles
      such as the Gameboy.</p></div>
