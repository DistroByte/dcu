    <p>What is a gaming PC? Well, computers were originally created for doing calculations and just ‘computing’ data, however as technology improved, 
       so did the capabilities of personal computers, and not long after people started creating video games for PCs. As time went on, games could 
       increase in graphics due to the increases in performance for PCs. Not long after all these improvements, the idea of a PC made for running specifically 
       games became normal, a ‘gaming PC’.</p>

     <p>Gaming PCs, as mentioned in the console section, were the first to move from disc games, to digital versions. This was due to the improved internet 
        capabilities and the access to the sites across the internet (which consoles would get later). Many sites and services like Steam and Epic Games are 
        now dedicated to selling digital games.</p>

     <p>Due to the widespread popularity of gaming PCs, many component manufacturers created new versions of components specifically aimed towards making games 
        run faster and smoother. Components like graphics processing unit, random access memory sticks, central processing unit are all needed in a PC for gaming, 
        with the more expensive versions of these components leading to better specs.</p>
