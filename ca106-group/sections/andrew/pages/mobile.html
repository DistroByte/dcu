    <p>Mobile phones have increased their capabilities over the years, along with improved specs, the introduction of a touch screen greatly 
       helped the advancement of games for mobile devices. Originally, games on button phones like the Nokia 3310 would be very simple, games 
       like snake and tetris, however with a touch screen it allows for a more fine control which leads to more complex games being developed.</p>

     <p>Many games for the phone are very simple, games along the lines of flappy bird where for each tap of the screen, the controllable bird 
        flaps its wings. Due to them being on the phone it makes them very accessible, and can be played almost everywhere.</p>

     <p>With the steady improvement of mobile devices, the games available have also improved, with many PC or console games like PUBG 
        (player unknown battlegrounds) and Fortnite now available to play on the go with a mobile device. Although using a mobile device is not 
        the best way to experience gaming, it allows for a greater audience to experience video games, and now has the majority of the market 
        share with gaming.</p>
