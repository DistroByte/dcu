    <p>Gaming PCs and consoles have the same purpose, running a video game, however there are many differences between these two different types of device, 
       with positives and negatives for each.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
    <p>One benefit to a PC is its functionality. Unlike a console, a gaming PC isn’t only confined to exclusively running games, they can still be used for 
       many tasks and work, and in general the best system for using the internet or doing work. PCs also have a wider range of games that you have access to, 
       many indie games (games made by a small studio) can’t afford to make games for the console platform, and generally have to release their game on PC 
       initially. Another benefit to PC gaming is the lack of a multiplayer subscription service. Many console companies have a subscription service for you 
       to have access to the multiplayer servers, they usually do this as they sell consoles at a loss and running multiplayer servers isn’t cheap, while on PC 
       the game publisher is 100% responsible for hosting the servers for their game.</p>

     <p>There are many benefits to PCs, however, consoles have some upsides too. When buying a game for a console, you know with 100% certainty that your device 
        will run it, as the game was specifically made to meet the spec requirements of the system, meanwhile, with a PC, only people who have invested a lot of 
        money in their PC can know if the game will run smoothly. Another benefit to consoles is their lack of customizability. Customization is king, being able 
        to choose all your components is great with a PC, however, it can lead to people with a larger sum of money having an advantage on the people with a lower 
        end system. Since consoles are the same, there is not such difference, and is a much more level playing field.</p>
