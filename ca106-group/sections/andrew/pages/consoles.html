    <p>What is a console? Well, a console, more specifically, a video game console, is an electronic device/computer device that runs 
       and then outputs video of a video game. They usually have some sort of external controller, however some handheld consoles have 
       built in controls, e.g Nintendo DSi.</p>
    <p>Consoles have become more and more widespread with the majority of households in possession of one. There are many household names 
       in the console market; with Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo being the most well known brands.</p>

     <p>The differences between Playstation and Xbox aren’t so great, they both can run games at similar if not equal speeds, and they both 
        reach roughly the same demographic. These two companies used to be at odds with each other, striving to outperform their rival. Just 
        a couple years ago you had to buy the same console as your friends to be able to join the same game as them, however, the two 
        companies recently decided to allow ‘cross platform’ play to allow people on different systems to join the same game. Nowadays, the 
        console people choose is based on the exclusive games to the specific console as there is no longer a barrier between Xbox and Playstation 
        players. 
        Consoles used to have to need a physical disc for you to play a game, however consoles have quickly adopted the PC method of 
        downloading/purchasing a game digitally.</p>

     <p>NIntendo has some similarities with the above consoles, however, their focus is more on handheld and portable consoles, such as the 
        Nintendo Switch. Due to their portable nature, they use cartridges instead of discs, however, they have also recently made the push 
        to digital. In general, Nintendo is considered the more casual system for gaming, and the focus at Nintendo is more on the games than 
        getting the best possible specifications for their consoles. For a more in depth look into Nintendo’s background and history .</p>
